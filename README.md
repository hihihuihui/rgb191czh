Last year, I went to the countryside to get my internship, my duty was to be a teacher, teaching the middle school students English. At first, I was not used to the environment, `enter code here`enter code here`it was so different from the city I live in, but I didnâ€™t want to give up, so I insisted and got used to the new environment.  When I came home, the students were sad, I also felt sad.** I am so thankful for the internship experience**, it fosters me with the ability to get used to the new environment.
